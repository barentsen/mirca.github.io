Hi there, my name is <b>Zé</b>!
<br><br>
I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Electrical Engineering at the Federal University of Campina Grande, Brazil.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
In 2014, I was awarded by the Brazilian Scientific Mobility Program a scholarship to study one year abroad in The Catholic University of America, Washington DC, USA. In that opportunity, I took a variety of classes among which my favorites were Stochastic Processes, Random Signal Theory, Information Theory, and Estimation and Detection Theory which are at the core of Machine Learning and Probabilistic algorithms.
</p>

In the Summer of 2015, I had the privilege to be an undergraduate guest researcher at the Nanofabrication Research Group, National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA, under the mentorship of Dr. Marcelo Davanço. In that opportunity, I implemented routines in MATLAB for single molecule localization microscopy and fluorescense localization imaging microscopy. More precisely, I developed Maximum Likelihood Estimators (along with Fisher Information Matrix) in order to localize and measure the brightness of nanoemitters. This work was part of a bigger projects which were later published on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00987-6.pdf"><i>Nature Communications</i></a> and <a href=http://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4976578><i>Review of Scientific Instruments</i></a>.
</p>

In the Spring of 2016 I went back to Brazil and got an undergraduate teaching assistant scholarship for the course of Probability and Statistics for Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Besides helping students understand basics concepts of probability theory during office hours, I also gave weekly lectures during which I solved exercises together with the students.

During the Summer of 2016 I took a gap semester in my undergraduate studies to become a student software developer for the Astropy Project as part of the Google Summer of Code program. In that occasion, I developed Python code to perform both unsupervised clustering and regression of Gaussian Mixture Models for point spread function (PSF) photometry. I had the privilege to be mentored by Dr. Hans Moritz Gunther, Dr. Brigitta Sipocz, and Dr. Erik Tollerud.

Beginning 2017, I started as an intern for the Kepler/K2 Guest Observer Office at NASA Ames, in Silicon Valley, USA, working on data analysis problems together with <a href="http://geert.io">Dr. Geert Barentsen</a>, Dr. Michael Gully-Santiago, Dr. Christina Hedges, and Dr. Ann Marie Cody.
</p>

In my spare time I enjoy taking my dog Pluto for a walk, drinking a good coffee, playing football, writing code for open source projects, playing chess, or reading books.

<i>Fun fact</i>: I was featured IEEE Student of the Week in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IEEEStudents/photos/a.285696968155912.70076.236454509746825/769475893111348/?type=1&theater">IEEE Students Facebook webpage</a>. \o/

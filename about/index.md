Hi there, my name is <b>Zé</b>!
<br><br>
I'm an undergraduate student pursing Electrical Engineering at the Federal University of Campina Grande, Brazil.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
In 2014, I was awarded by the Brazilian Scientific Mobility Program a scholarship to study one year abroad in The Catholic University of America, DC, USA. In that opportunity, I was privileged to take a variety of classes among which my favorites were Stochastic Processes, Random Signal Theory, Information Theory, and Estimation and Detection Theory which are at the core of Machine Learning and Probabilistic algorithms.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
In the Summer of 2015, I worked as an undergraduate guest researcher with Marcelo Davanço, in the Nanofabrication Research Group, National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA. In that opportunity, I implemented routines in MATLAB for single molecule localization microscopy and fluorescense localization imaging microscopy. More precisely, I developed Maximum Likelihood Estimators (along with Fisher Information Matrix) in order to localize and measure the brightness of nanoemitters.

In the Spring of 2016, I held a teaching assistant scholarship for the course of Probability and Statistics for Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Besides helping students understand basics concepts of probability theory during office hours, I also gave weekly lectures during which I solved exercises together with the students.

During the Summer of 2016, I was a student software developer for the Astropy Project under the Google Summer of Code program. In that occasion, I developed Python code to perform both unsupervised clustering and regression of Gaussian Mixture Models for point spread function fitting photometry. I was mentored by Hans Moritz Gunther, Brigitta Sipocz, and Erik Tollerud.

Besides loving mathematics, coding, and physics, I also love a good coffee, chess, running, and soccer.

Beginning 2017, I started as an intern for the Kepler/K2 Guest Observer Office at NASA Ames, Silicon Valley, working on data analysis problems together with <a href="http://geert.io">Geert Barentsen</a>.
</p>

I was featured IEEE Student of the Week in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IEEEStudents/photos/a.285696968155912.70076.236454509746825/769475893111348/?type=1&theater">IEEE Students Facebook webpage</a>. \o/

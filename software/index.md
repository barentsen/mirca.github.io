Hello World!

I love Python and I love the fact that nowadays Python is being used in science and engineering more than <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2017-top-programming-languages">ever</a>!
Python has a mature set of general purposes libraries that help scientists extract the
best out of their data.

Among some libraries, I couldn't forget to mention numpy (numerical computation),
scipy (scientific programming), matplotlib (visualization), pandas (data processing),
and scikit-learn (data science/machine learning).

Most of the success around Python and its libraries is due to their fast-growing, energetic, and welcoming communities.
Those libraries I mentioned are developed in a daily basis by experts from academia and industry
and also by students.

In the past years, I've been involved with open source software development primarily thanks to Google ❤️, Github ❤️, and NASA ❤️.

Here is a list of projects I'm more involved with:

* <a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy">astropy</a>: A community Python library for Astronomy
* <a href="https://github.com/astropy/photutils">photutils</a>: Image photometry in Python
* <a href="https://github.com/keplergo/pyke">pyke</a>: A suite of Python tools to analyze Kepler/K2 data
* <a href="https://github.com/keplergo/oktopus">oktopus</a>: A soft-bodied, eight-armed package for beautiful inference

I've been also contributing code for <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy">numpy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/scipy/scipy">scipy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/scikit-optimize/scikit-optimize">scikit-optimize</a>, and many others.

Hi all!

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Although we already implemented a PSF photometry routine that works, we have been discussing what is the best interface for users. In that sense, I basically worked towards concluding the PRs regarding the GROUP functionality and the main PSF photometry class according many suggestions from the mentors team.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Additionally, the PR which changed the interface of the FIND functionality (<a href="https://github.com/astropy/photutils/pull/379">#379</a>) and the PR which allows one to get uncertainties on fitted parameters (<a href="https://github.com/astropy/photutils/pull/376">#376</a>) were merged.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Please, check on the links of the PRs that I'm currently working on: <a href="https://github.com/astropy/photutils/pull/385"> #385</a>, <a href="https://github.com/astropy/photutils/pull/369">#369</a>.
</p>

<i>Now, to work! :)</i>

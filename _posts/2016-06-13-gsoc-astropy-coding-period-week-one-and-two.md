Hi all!

Coding for astropy and interacting with mentors have been quite awesome so far!

Thanks to the mentors, I have been very focused and guided on my coding activities, as a result I have a notebook <a href="https://github.com/mirca/ze-gsoc16-photutils/blob/master/nstar_example.ipynb">here</a> which gives a glimpse of the point spread function photometry in crowded fields.

Currently, I'm working on improving the GROUP functionality, see PR <a href="https://github.com/astropy/photutils/pull/369">here</a>. Also, a PR for the NSTAR functionality will be proposed soon :)

<i>Now, to work! :)</i>
